# Credit Risk Analysis

### **Purpose**
- The purpose of this project was to predict whether someone is a high or low credit risk. We are using a supervised machine learning algorithm in order to help determine the credit risk. 

### **Summary** 
- After perfoming oversampling, undersampling and a combination of the two, I weas able to predict loans that would be a high risk and the best model to use. I then used ensembles classifiers to resample the data and predict the loans. This provided a higher accuracy so it is used over the other muodules.
